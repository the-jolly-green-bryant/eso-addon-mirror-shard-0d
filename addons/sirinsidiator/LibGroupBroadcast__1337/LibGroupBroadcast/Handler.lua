--- Declares a custom event that can be used to send messages without data to other group members with minimal overhead or throws an error if the declaration failed.

--- https://wiki.esoui.com/LibGroupBroadcast_IDs

--- you should only do so in a non-intrusive way (e.g. when they actively interact with features that require it).
