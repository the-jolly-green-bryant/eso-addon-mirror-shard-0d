--
-- To all you helpful individuals who romp in here to add things
-- on your own, thank you.
--
-- I'm sorry my updates overwrite your changes and you have to constantly
-- backup this file or ignore updates in order to keep your version working.
--
-- If you'd like to submit a pull request on GitHub, I'd happily take a look.
--
--      https://github.com/inimicus/cooldowns
--
-- Here is some information that might be helpful:
--
-- Debugging/Finding IDs:
-- When finding information about new sets, you can get chat log spammed with
-- information about every EVENT_COMBAT_EVENT by typing in game chat:
--
--      /cool all on
--
-- You'll get spammed with all the abilities in chat. There might even be
-- a similar debug for effects commented somewhere else in the code, too.
--
-- Proc your set/synergy/whatever, then look for it in the chat. You'll get
-- the name, the ID, and the result. Take note of these values and then add
-- them to the Sets table below along with any other values needed.
--
-- Turn off chat spam with:
--
--      /cool all off
--
-- Easy as that.
--
-- PvPCooldownTracker.Data.Sets (table):
-- This table contains all the set, synergy, and passive information that
-- the addon uses. But you probably already knew that.
--
-- Each entry is stored in a table with its key being the string name
-- of the set to track. Because of this, non-English clients don't work.
--
-- There are plans to implement better tracking that doesn't use the set name
-- and there is already a new branch on GitHub to track efforts there. But it
-- is quite a bit out of date, unfortunately.
--
-- Big thanks to Baertram for helping out on multi-language support.
--
-- Configuration Options:
--
-- * procType (string):     One of "set", "synergy", or "passive" to indicate
--                          what kind of tracking it is. Duhhhhh.
--
-- * event (number):        What kind of action identifies the proc happened.
--                          Generally this is EVENT_COMBAT_EVENT or 131102, but
--                          some other values do exist (Wyrd Tree, others).
--
-- * description (string):  Cosmetic. Adds a description to the tooltip.
--
-- * settingsColor (string):    Color in hex. Used to be used for the colors
--                              for each set in the settings menu, but since
--                              the menu was updated they aren't used. Will
--                              probably clean them up at some point.
--
-- * id (number | array):   The ID that identifies the proc condition.
--                          This can also be an array of numbers for proc
--                          conditions that span multiple IDs (Perfected/Non,
--                          synergies, stupid Pirate Skelly, and more).
--
-- * enabled (bool):        Used to identify if tracking and display are enabled.
--                          This is different from if the set is enabled in the
--                          settings. That's a different value stored in savedvars.
--                          This value is pointless here and will probably be
--                          removed in the future.
--
-- * result (number):       The result of the proc. These are numeric, defined
--                          in the table using their constants. When debugging,
--                          the number will appear instead of the constant name,
--                          so refer to the constants section below to match.
--
-- * cooldownDurationMs (number):   Number in milliseconds for the cooldown.
--                                  e.g. 30 seconds is 30000
--
-- * onCooldown (bool):     If the set is on cooldown.
--                          This is also pointless here and will
--                          probably be removed in the future.
--
-- * timeOfProc (number):   Time that the proc happened, used in maths to
--                          provide the countdown and cooldown time remaining.
--                          Pointless here, will be removed in the future.
--
-- * texture (string):      The path to the texture to use for the cooldown
--                          display. You can find textures with the TextureIt
--                          addon (though what's there is largely out of date)
--                          or via the method `GetAbilityIcon([abilityId])`.
--                          I just generally use any icon that doesn't
--                          look like ass. A lot look like ass.
--
-- * showFrame (bool):      Enables or disables showing the frame around
--                          the icon. Not used for monster helm icons.
--                          But most monster helm icons look like ass.
--
-- Constants:
--
-- Reference this section to make sense of what result and event numbers in
-- debug messages mean.
--
-- Results:
-- ACTION_RESULT_DAMAGE                 = 1
-- ACTION_RESULT_POWER_ENERGIZE         = 128
-- ACTION_RESULT_HEAL                   = 16
-- ACTION_RESULT_EFFECT_GAINED          = 2240 - The most common
-- ACTION_RESULT_EFFECT_GAINED_DURATION = 2245 - Use 2240 if both show up
-- ACTION_RESULT_ABILITY_ON_COOLDOWN    = 2080

-- Events:
-- EVENT_ABILITY_COOLDOWN_UPDATED       = 131181
-- EVENT_COMBAT_EVENT                   = 131102
-- EVENT_EFFECT_CHANGED                 = 131150
